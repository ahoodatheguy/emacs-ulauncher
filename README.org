/Open your daemons with ease using Ulauncher./

* Installation Instructions
Installing through Ulauncher doesn't work yet. Instead you have to install it manually.


#+begin_src sh :results silent
  git clone https://github.com/ahoodatheguy/emacs-ulauncher ~/.local/share/ulauncher/extensions/emacs-ulauncher/
#+end_src

Now restart Ulauncher and type "client".
